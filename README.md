# Customer-Churn-Pipeline

Accomplished: 
- Essentially take a big spreadsheet of customer details and clean it such that the computer can read it. 
- Look at graphs to understand patterns and train the computer, with this pattern recognition, to see which customers will quit or not. 
- Program into a pipeline that can be used to make new predictions.
